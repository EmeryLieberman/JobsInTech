    GPS is owned and operated by the Department of Defense with satellites that
    are controlled by the Air Force. GPS is a fundamental part of life in the
    modern world, as itâ€™s available in applications and products like Google
    Maps to cell phones and shipping containers. The perception of the military
     is often just brute force and intense conditioning. However, they have many
     positions in STEM, especially in tech, and GPS is just one of them.

    Not only does access to GPS revolutionize the technology industry, it helps
    keep us safe. GPS is used in assessing and pinpointing the source of natural
    disasters like earthquakes. It helps us send distress signals and be able to
     evacuate civilians. It is used by law enforcement in numerous ways. It
     allows you to locate yourself on the high seas or featureless Saharan
     desert where there may not be any landmarks to orient yourself because
     it does not depend on any terrestrial system, and so, so much more.
