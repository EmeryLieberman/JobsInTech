    Websites make up the majority of what we think of as the internet. From
    large-scale sites like Amazon and Wikipedia to small businesses and chat
    rooms, behind all of that are web programmers. Web development and design are
    unique for their capability for remote, yet well-paid workers. It will be a
    necessary job as long as internet browsing is around.
  <p>
    Web developers create the website,building up the body through HTML, Javascript,
    Python and many other coding languages. They make the website functional and usable
    for whoever needs it. Web desginers are another critical part of web programming.
    Web designers improve user experience and personalize websites to fit the needs
    and wants of the person or company that runs it. This is accomplished through
    coding languages like CSS, Python, and PHP.

  <p>
    The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the need for web programmers is
    projected to grow 13% by 2028, and will only increase from there. In comparison,
    the average growth rate for nearly all other jobs is nearly a third of that or
    less. The increasing popularity of mobile devices, technology, and ecommerce
    will likely drive up the demand for web developers and designers far into the future.
